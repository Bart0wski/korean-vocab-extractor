# Korean Vocabulary Extractor

A full-stack web app that extracts Korean-French vocabulary from text, PDFs, and images using the **Google Gemini API**, stores results in a local SQLite database, and lets you review, filter, and export your word list — all from a browser UI.

Built as a personal study tool for TOPIK preparation.

---

## Features

- **4 input sources** — paste text, upload PDFs, upload images, or import a CSV directly
- **AI extraction** — Gemini reads each source and returns Korean word, French translation, example sentence, part of speech, and thematic tag
- **Human-in-the-loop review** — extracted items appear in an editable table before being saved; edit or remove anything before committing
- **SSE progress streaming** — live progress bar while PDFs and images are processed page by page
- **PDF page splitting** — multi-page PDFs are split into single pages and sent to Gemini individually for accurate OCR on scanned documents
- **History table** — searchable, filterable by part of speech and tag, paginated (10 / 50 / 100 / all)
- **Inline editing** — click any cell in the history table (French, phrase, POS, tag) to edit it in place
- **POS badges** — color-coded part-of-speech labels (Noun, Verb, Adjective…)
- **Bulk operations** — select multiple entries to export, delete, or re-tag in one click
- **Bulk re-tag / change POS** — update `thematic_tag` or `part_of_speech` across all selected rows at once
- **Duplicate merge** — when duplicates are found at commit time, a comparison table lets you choose which field values to keep
- **CSV export** — export all or selected vocabulary to CSV (Anki-compatible)
- **Anki .apkg export** — export directly to an Anki deck file with POS and tag as card tags
- **Statistics dashboard** — words by POS (bar chart), words per week (line chart), tag breakdown (bar chart), TOPIK I/II coverage progress bars
- **Structured logging** — terminal logs + `logs/app.log` + browser console with timestamps

## Setup

### 1. Get a Gemini API key

Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create a key.

### 2. Create a `.env` file

Create `Gemini_project/.env` (two levels above `backend/`):

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
cd vocab_app/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
cd vocab_app
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

> The SQLite database `vocab.db` is created automatically on first run.

## How It Works

### Processing pipeline

```
Input (text / PDF / image / CSV)
        │
        ▼
FastAPI route receives the file(s)
        │
        ├── PDF  → pypdf splits into single-page PDFs
        │          → each page uploaded to Gemini File API
        │
        ├── Image → uploaded to Gemini File API
        │
        └── Text  → sent directly as a Gemini text prompt
                │
                ▼
        Gemini returns JSON array of vocabulary items
                │
                ▼
        SSE stream sends progress + results to browser
                │
                ▼
        Review table (editable) — user approves before saving
                │
                ▼
        POST /api/vocabulary/commit → SQLite
```

### Human-in-the-loop review

Nothing is saved automatically. After extraction you see an editable table where you can:
- Fix any field (Korean, French, phrase, POS, tag)
- Delete unwanted rows
- Apply a batch deck tag to all rows
- Click **Commit to Database** to save

### Duplicate detection

Before saving, each word is checked against the `korean` column (unique constraint). Duplicates are reported but not re-inserted.

## Database Schema

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer | Primary key |
| `korean` | String | Unique — dictionary form |
| `french` | String | French translation |
| `phrase` | String | Example sentence |
| `part_of_speech` | String | Noun / Verb / Adjective… |
| `thematic_tag` | String | e.g. "TOPIK 1", "Kdrama" |
| `created_at` | DateTime | Auto-set on insert |

## Anki Study Settings — Study Both Directions in the Same Session

By default Anki hides the reverse card until the next day. Two settings fix this:

### 1. Disable "Bury siblings" *(most important)*

**Deck Options → "Bury related new cards until the next day" → OFF**

Without this, when you study the Korean→French card, Anki hides the French→Korean card until tomorrow.

### 2. Set sort order so both sides appear back to back

Requires the **V3 Scheduler** (Anki 2.1.45+):

1. **Tools → Preferences** → enable **"V3 Scheduler"** if not already on
2. **Deck Options → New Cards → New card sort order** → **"Random note, then template"**

This gives you: word A Korean→French · word A French→Korean · word B Korean→French · word B French→Korean… — both sides of the same word back to back, words in random order.

> With 20 new cards/day you study **10 new words/day** (2 cards each), seeing both directions in the same session.
